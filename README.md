# Smart-Lift-System-using-ESP32-Python-OpenCV
A prototype of an intelligent, camera-based crowd-aware elevator system built using ESP32, Arduino C, Python, and OpenCV. This system automatically detects the most crowded floor using live camera feeds and navigates the lift to serve that floor. Once the task is done, the lift returns to the ground floor.
